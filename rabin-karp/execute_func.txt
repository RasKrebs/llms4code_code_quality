Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into business processes has garnered significant 
attention, with particularly automated code generation emerging as a promising area. Tools
like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are increasingly being implemented in development pro-
cesses, hinting at potential gains in developer efficiency and productivity (Poldrack et al.,
2023). While efficiency and productivity is advantageous, it represents only one facet of
a successful development process. Despite this, there remains little research exploring the
value added and effects on the software development process of such tools. Furthermore,
integrating new technologies in any business process is often accompanied by establishing
frameworks that outline their effective use. Such methodologies are crucial for effectively
harnessing the potential of these innovations but have yet to be extensively explored in the
current context. MOTIVATION Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are increas-
