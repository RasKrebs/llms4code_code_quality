# General Application Domain Info
domain: Data Processing
application: String Pattern Matching
algorithm: Rabin-Karp Algorithm

# Prompts
long_prompt: """
Implement Rabin-Karp algorithm in Python from scratch. The implementation should take
two strings as input, a text string and a pattern string, and two optional arguments 
for the base and prime number to use in the hash function. If not provided, common 
default values should be used. The output should be the index of the first occurrence
The output should be the index of the first occurrence of the pattern in the text, 
or -1 if the pattern is not found. The algorithm should be implemented using a rolling
hash function. Make sure to add all the necessary documentation to the class and methods 
in the form of docstrings and comments. Consider common edge cases or errors in the 
function and include steps for handling these. Also make sure to add type hints throughout. 
Follow the best practices for writing clean and efficient code.
