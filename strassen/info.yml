# General Application Domain Info
domain: HPC
application: Matrix Multiplication
algorithm: Strassen

# Prompts
long_prompt: """
Implement the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication in Python from scratch. The 
implementation should take two matrices as input and return the product of the two matrices,
the matrices can be either a list of lists, a numpy array or a pandas dataframe. The inputs 
should be checked to ensure that they are valid matrices and that they can be multiplied, 
including checking that the matrices are symmetric, have equal dimensions, and that the 
dimensions are powers of 2. The algorithm should be implemented recursively, with a base 
case for small matrices where the standard matrix multiplication algorithm is used. The 
algorithm should be implemented in a way that minimizes the number of recursive calls and 
matrix additions. Implement the necessary steps to handle edge cases and common errors. The 
implementation should be well-documented with comments and docstrings, and should follow 
common conventions for Python code. Type hints should be used throughout.
