# General Application Domain Info
domain: Machine Learning
application: Computer Vision
algorithm: Convolution Operation

long_prompt: """
Implement convolution from scratch in Python. The class should at initalization
take the padding, stride and dialation as inputs, in either integer or a tuple 
corresponding to width and height. Implement the necessary steps to handle these 
differing inputs, such as transforming integers into a tuple with each value 
equaling the input integer. Moreover, check that each input corresponds to an 
interger. After the class is initialized, the run method should take an image 
and a kernel as inputs. Add methods to handle common edge cases such as the 
kernel not being a square matrix, that the kernel is the correct size for the 
image. If the kernel is a list, it should be converted to a numpy array. Make 
sure to check that the kernel is a square matrix and that it is the correct 
size for the image. The output should be the convolved image. 

Make sure to add all the necessary documentation to the class and methods in the 
form of docstrings and comments. Also make sure to add type hints throughout.
Follow the common conventions for Python code.
