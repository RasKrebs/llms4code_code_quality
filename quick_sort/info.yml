### General Application Domain Info
domain: High Performance Computing
application: Sorting Algorithms
algorithm: Quick Sort

long_prompt: """
Implement the quick sort algoritmh for sorting thoruhg a list of integers. The implementation shall be build from scratch in Python 
using no special libraries. The implementation should take a list of integers as input and return a sorted list, but make sure to 
add the ability to handle different, yet common inputs, and throw relevant errors. Make sure to add documentation to the function 
in the form of docstrings and comments, and also make sure to implement necessary try/catch statements to handle errors, unwanted 
datatypes and more. Implement type hints aswell and follow any common best practices for Python coding.

Implement the quick sort algoritmh from scratch in Python using no special libraries. The implementation shall take a list integer as 
input and return a sorted version of said list. Make sure to add documentation in the form of docstrings and comments, as well as 
follow any best practices for python coding.
