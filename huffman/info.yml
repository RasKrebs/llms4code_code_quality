# Application domain info yaml, to store data used during data collection

# General Application Domain Info
domain: Data Processing
application:  Data Compression
algorithm: Huffman Coding

# Prompts
long_prompt: """
Implement the Huffman coding algorithm for data compression in Python from scratch. The 
implementation should take a string as input and return the compressed version of the 
string. Make sure to add statements that handles this input, ensuring it is a string. 
Partition the implementation into different parts, such as a tree generator, 
huffman_code_tree and a nodetree object. Make sure to add the ability to handle 
different, yet common inputs, and throw relevant errors. Make sure to add documentation
to the function in the form of docstrings and comments, and also make sure to implement 
necessary try/catch statements to handle errors, unwanted datatypes and more. Implement 
type hints as well and follow any common best practices for Python coding.
